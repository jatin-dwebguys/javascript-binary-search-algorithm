# Binary search algorithm

With this little helper you just pass your array and what you are looking for and it will return you back a result array, a typical use would look like this:

    var searchResult = searchBinary("m", array, true)
    the parameters are : searchBinary(search string, array to search, case insensitive?)

This will return an array with all items starting by the letter m. A good use of this script would be with a auto-complete widget.
